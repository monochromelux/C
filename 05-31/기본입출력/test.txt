Republican Donald Trump put aside the celebrations and 
focused on Wednesday on his 73-day transition to the White House 
as rival Hillary Clinton promised to bury 
the bitterness of their long presidential race
and work to unify a divided country.
After Trump's stunning upset of the heavily favored Clinton, 
Democratic President Barack Obama 
and leading figures in the Republican Party who had struggled to
make peace with Trump all vowed to move past the ugliness of
the campaign to seek common ground.
